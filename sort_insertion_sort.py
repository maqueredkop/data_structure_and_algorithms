"""

## The maximum number of comparisons for an insertion sort is the sum of the 
## first nâˆ’1 integers. Again, this is O(n^2). 

## One note about shifting versus exchanging is also important. In general, 
## a shift operation requires approximately a third of the processing work of 
## an exchange since only one assignment is performed.
